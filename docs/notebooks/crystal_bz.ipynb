    "# Brillouin Zone Integration on a Photonic Crystal\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is derived from this [script](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fmmax/blob/main/examples/crystal.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional FMM or RCWA solvers have a significant limitation: they require both the structures and sources to be periodic. Simulating an aperiodic source necessitates the use of a supercell, which can be computationally demanding due to the unfavorable complexity scaling.\n",
    "FMMAX, however, offers a solution to this issue by employing Brillouin Zone (BZ) integration. This method has a distinct advantage: it allows a supercell to be transformed into several smaller primitive unit cells, which can then be simulated independently in batch. This approach significantly reduces computational demands, making it a more efficient solution for handling aperiodic sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore two scenarios using BZ integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) A dipole source inside a photonic crystal slab. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The crystal has a square unit cell with circular holes, having cross section\n",
    "    and dipole position as illustrated below. The dipole is located the lower-left\n",
    "    corner of the unit cell centered in the supercell defined by the Brillouin grid\n",
    "    shape. The dipole is x-oriented and centered vertically within the photonic\n",
    "    crystal slab.\n",

    "        x-dipole -> o________________|\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) A \"broadband\" (with 3 wavelengths) Gaussian beam incident on a photonic crystal slab.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The crystal has a square unit cell with circular holes as illustrated below.\n",
